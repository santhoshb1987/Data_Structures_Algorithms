DSA Tutorial - Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
Last Updated : 24 Mar, 2025
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.

Why to Learn DSA?
Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer.
DSA is foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc
Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA in interviews.

16. Linked List
Linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers. Unlike arrays, nodes of linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations and can only be accessed sequentially, starting from the head of list.

Branch and Bound : Used in combinatorial optimization problems to systematically search for the best solution. It works by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, or branches, and then eliminating certain branches based on bounds on the optimal solution. This process continues until the best solution is found or all branches have been explored.
